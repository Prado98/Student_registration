# Student_registration
Student registration platform with a seperate module for teachers for monitoring the student registration.

After cloning the repository run npm i to install all the dependencies.
Since the project uses firebase's database as the database you have to initialize a new service key.
After installing the dependencies, run node index.js to run the server.
